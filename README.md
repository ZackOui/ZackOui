Hi! I'm Zack Oma.

I don't wanna reveal my age. (I'm a minor.)

My zodiac sign is Taurus.

My pronouns are (he/him/they)

I am straight.

And my birthday is May 4th!

I'm into FNF and many other fandoms.

Also, I have school. This means that I might be slow to respond.

I can only respond during my lunch break (11:50pm) and after school ends (3:00pm).

Or if it's Tuesday, (I have no school on Tuesday.) I can respond.

Tomorrow will be a really busy day for me because I have like 11+ assignments for me to do.

And that's about it for this small introduction to myself!
